> What it means is that recursion allows you to express the value of a function in terms of other values of that function. Common sense tells you that if you implement your function in a way that the recursive calls are done in advance, and stored for easy access, it will make your program faster. 


> This is what we call Memoization - it is memorizing the results of some specific states, which can then be later accessed to solve other sub-problems


<hr>

> If you are given a problem, which can be broken down into smaller sub-problems, and these smaller subproblems can still be broken into smaller ones - and if you manage to find out that there are some overlapping subproblems, then you've encountered a DP problem


ðŸŽ¯The intuition behind dynamic programming is that we trade space for time, i.e. to say that instead of calculating all the states taking a lot of time but no space, we take up space to store the results of all the sub-problems to save time later.

# A simple lay man illustration

1. Writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper.

2. "What's that equal to?"

3. Counting "Eight!"

4. Writes down another "1+" on the left.

5. "What about that?"

6. "Nine!" " How'd you know it was nine so fast?"

7. "You just added one more!"

8. "So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were eight! Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say remembering stuff to save time later!"


<hr>


<h2> ðŸŽ¯Let's try to understand this by taking an example of Fibonacci numbers. </h2>

```
Fibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 0

Fibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 1

Fibonacci (n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)

```

> So, the first few numbers in this series will be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... and so on!



<h2> :keyboard:A code for it using pure recursion:</h2>

```
 
 int fib (int n)
 
 {
 
        if (n < 2)
        
            return 1;
            
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
        
    }
    
```
    
    
<h2> :keyboard:Using Dynamic Programming approach with memoization: </h2>

```

void fib () 

{

        fibresult[0] = 1;
        
        fibresult[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i<n; i++)
        
           fibresult[i] = fibresult[i-1] + fibresult[i-2];
           
    }
    
   
```

<h3> :star:Are we using a different recurrence relation in the two codes? No. Are we doing anything different in the two codes? Yes. </h3>

> In the recursive code, a lot of values are being recalculated multiple times. We could do good with calculating each unique quantity only once. Take a look at the image to understand that how certain values were being recalculated in the recursive way:

# Majority of the Dynamic Programming problems can be categorized into two types:

1. Optimization problems.

2. Combinatorial problems.

<hr>


**Every Dynamic Programming problem has a schema to be followed:**

- Show that the problem can be broken down into optimal sub-problems.
- Recursively define the value of the solution by expressing it in terms of optimal solutions for smaller sub-problems.
- Compute the value of the optimal solution in bottom-up fashion.
- Construct an optimal solution from the computed information.

Priya read the concepts of binary exponentiation, and wondered if she could use the same concept over matrix multiplication. 
On the same time she also remembered the knuth's method of finding the fibbonacci series using matrix exponentiation. 

Help her code the matrix exponentiation to find the nth fibbonacci number.

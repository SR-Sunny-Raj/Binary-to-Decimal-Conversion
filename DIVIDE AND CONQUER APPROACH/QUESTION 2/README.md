After reading the concepts of finding the maximum element in an array using divide and conquer, 
Harsh was very curious to find the time complexity of the algorithm. The time complexity came out to be O(n). 

Now Harsh got confused because, the normal iterative method also gave O(n), but his teacher told him that the divide and conquer method 
is more efficent than the iterative one. 

**Help Harsh to come up with a code to prove that the divide and conquer method is efficient.**

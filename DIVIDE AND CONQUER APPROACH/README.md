> Sometimes when you’re trying to solve a problem, you would feel as if “Hmm, the problem is pretty big to solve on one go” and you would break the problem into halves or quarters and try to solve it. 

> If the problem is still not manageable to solve, you will further reduce the problem into a manageable size and try to solve it. That exactly is what divide and conquer is. 

> Breaking up your problems into sub-problems, until your reach a sub-problem which can be solved easily and then reconstructing or combining the answers you got from the sub-problems, which’ll give you the answer to the bigger problem.

> <h3> 1. Think of a scenario where you might be asked to write an essay, what will you do? Write the whole essay in one go?  But what is a smarter way to do it? </h3>

- An essay is composed of paragraph, a paragraph is composed of sentences, sentences are composed of words and the words are not that hard to write, aren’t they?
- You realize writing a whole essay in one go is harder so you break the problem into manageable sized paragraph, writing paragraphs are harder so you break it into manageable sized sentences, still if it’s hard you break the sentences into manageable words. 
- You’ll construct the words, then you’ll combine the words into sentences and then the sentences into paragraphs and then paragraphs into a beautify essay.

> - Let’s say a firm wants to develop a killer Application to extend its reach, developing a project is not an easy task, and one person cannot handle everything that makes the success of the product, so the firm divides the problem into manageable sub-problems for their ‘Technical Team’ and ‘Management Team’ to solve. 

> - But wait, developing an application is not that easy either, so the application is further divided into manageable sub-tasks so that their ‘Web Dev’ Team and ‘ML’ Team can work on and the ‘Testing’ Team can test the final product.  

> - In the same way, there are a lot of different managerial decisions need to be taken and implemented to make the application a success, since it’s an harder task, it’s further divided into manageable sub-tasks given to ‘PR-Works team’ and ‘Documentation Team’ who take Managerial decisions on the application developed (or the problem solved) by the development team, hence by reconstructing or combining the application (or answers) you got from the Technical Team and Management Team, a bigger problem of Developing the Killer Application will be solved.

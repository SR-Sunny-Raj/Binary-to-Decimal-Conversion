# :hourglass:REAL TIME ILLUSTRATION ON RECURSION

> The below real life example consists of 3 kids who seeks a permission for  meet up.

- In the first stage A asks B.
- In the second stage B asks C.
- In the third stage C asks his parents.


<br>

- On approval from parents, C provides a appropriate response to B.
- In turn B provides a response to A.

# :keyboard:CODE + PICTORIAL ILLUSTRATIONS:

> <h3> Shown below is a pictorial represetation of base condition and call stack for factorial of a number. </h3>


<h2> :star:The code is provided in the 
 
[Factorial File](https://github.com/ISTE-VIT/The-Algo-Companion/blob/main/RECURSION/SOLVED%20EXAMPLES/FACTORIAL)</h2>

- As seen, factorial of number 3 is calculated using recursion.
- The fact function is recursively called until the base condition is met.
- Once the base condition is satisfied the, call stack comes into action and the values are popped out with the final result at the end.

> <h3> Here's another example on recursion explaining the Sum of Numbers. </h3>

<h2> :star:The code is provided in the 
 
[Sum Of Numbers file](https://github.com/ISTE-VIT/The-Algo-Companion/blob/main/RECURSION/SOLVED%20EXAMPLES/SUM%20OF%20NUMBERS)</h2>

- As illustrated, we are performing the addition of 3 numbers as shown.
- We keep calling the Add function recursively untill the number of arguments to the Add function decrease to 1.
- Once the base condtion satisfies, the call stack comes into action and returns the sub-results at each pop printing the final result at the final pop of the stack.

> Recursion can be defined as the technique of replicating or doing again an activity in a self-similar way calling itself again and again, and the process continues till specific condition reaches. 
> In the world of programming, when your program lets you call that specific function from inside that function, then this concept of calling the function from itself can be termed as recursion, and the function which makes this possible is called recursive function.

<h2>:star:Recursion is really easy to understand. It is essentially a function calling itself.<h2>

# ðŸŽ¯Fundamental Concepts of Recursion
	
> <h4> Base Case </h4>
	
The base case (or base condition) is the state where the programâ€™s solution has been reached. Recursive methods are built with two paths: the method first checks if the base state has been reached, if yes, the method ends and returns the current data, if not the method instead goes the other path and executes the recursive case, altering the input and calling the method again.

**To help contextualize this, consider a hypothetical example.**

- Imagine a search programâ€™s base case is when a searched value is found, or value_searched = cell_value. If the values donâ€™t match, the currently selected cell isnâ€™t the solution.

- The method then executes the recursive step, selecting another item in the data set and calls the method again using this new cell as input.

- If we did not have the base case, the program would simply repeat the recursive step and therefore scroll the data set infinitely.

> <h4> Call Stack </h4>

- The call stack is an integrated, hidden data structure within all modern programing languages. By storing active subroutines in a stack structure, the program is able to execute subroutines in the order they were received.

- Each recursive call in a program causes a nesting effect in the call stack, adding more subroutines that must be finished before the stack is empty.

- Broadly speaking, the larger the call stack, the more memory and time that is needed for the program to run.

# :keyboard:ILLUSTRATION BY CODE:
Just imagine writing a function that calculates the factorial of a number n (n!). 

Lets see how it would expand for 4!. Remember that 1! = 1.
  
:star2:(factorial 4)
  
:star2:(4 * (factorial 3))
  
:star2:(4 * (3 * (factorial 2)))
  
:star2:(4 * (3 * (2 * (factorial 1))))
  
:star2:(4 * (3 * (2 * 1)))
  
:star2:(4 * (3 * 2))
  
:star2:(4 * 6)
  
:star2:(24)

The factorial keeps multiplying the current number by the factorial of the number before it (4 * 3!) until it reaches its terminating condition (1! = 1) which then allows all the functions before it to evaluate the return statement (n * factorial(n-1)) and pass it back up the stack.

> <h3>Translated to C++ code: <h3>

int factorial(int n)
  
	if(n == 1)
  
		return 1;
  
	else
  
		return n * factorial(n-1);
  

A recursive function takes an input, determines if it should stop (here, if n == 1) or perform an operation (here, multiplying n by something) and passing the remainder of the argument (here, all of the numbers less than n, and > 1) to itself to do it all over again until it stops.
  
Every time you call a function, the computer goes off to evaluate that function for the arguments you passed in and then when that is done, it returns back to the original function call and returns a value. 

So when you call return n * factorial(n-1) the computer stops here to go evaluate factorial(n-1) and so on and so on until something different comes back (1) which then allows all of the stopped processes to return a value.
